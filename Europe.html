	<h3>Routes of Europe</h3>
	<h4>By Dáithí O'Connell</h4>
	
	<p>After finding myself with exactly 21 days’ holidays I wanted to make sure I got every last minute out of a diverse and action packed holiday. One thing I love about Europe is the drastic change of culture and surroundings granted by such short trips as you cross borders.</p>
	
	<p> Before jetting off to Dubrovnik in Croatia I used <a href="http://interrailplanner.com">InterrailPlanner</a> to create this map as an outline for my journey.<p>
	
	<figure><img src="images/interplan.jpg" width=100%/><figcaption>My interrail Journey planned out</figcaption></figure>
	
	<p>The overlapping destinations in the bottom left hand corner consists of destinations in Montenegro and my island-hopping experience in Croatia which I will touch on first.</p>
	
	<p>I cannot highly recommend this route enough it gave me a beautiful combination of both coastal scenery and hustle and bustle of top European city’s also.
On day one I travelled to Kotor from Dublin via Dubrovnik airport. Kotor was the highlight of my trip as I knew so little about this gem of a destination in my preparation. 
 Situated in between two interlocking peninsulas this small city is surrounded by mountains whilst also being on the coast. 
 I highly recommend walking to the top of the old town walls and catching the early sunset before the mountains eclipse the sun.</p>

 <p>Dubrovnik, this city has become very well-known since game of thrones began filming here. The old town is beautiful (and spotless). However, being a backpacker I found it very expensive mainly due to the increase in tourists caused by the game of thrones popularity. Although to put a price of gazing into the Adriatic Sea is priceless. With temperatures of Kotor throughout Croatia being mid to high 20 degrees having the sea at your disposal at almost any time to cool down was wonderful.</p>
 
 <p>The next part of my holiday was the island-hopping part. First destination was Hvar a once quiet island but now a popular holiday resort. And when you get there you’ll know why it has built up this popularity. One of biggest highlights of my holiday was sailing around the various pieces of land around Hvar. We rented a boat via our hostel and sailed to the secluded and scenic beached and islands. Come nigh time the party life is busy, although expensive for backpackers. There is one nightclub carpe diem, which is located on an island. You are required to get a taxi boat from Hvar (which is included in the admission). I recommend going here for the experience and atmosphere.</p>
 
 <p>When I arrived in Bra&#269; it was the 1st of September so it was very quiet, but judging by the atmosphere this seems to be the quieter island next to Hvar. Not a huge party life but a nice place to chill by the beach and eat food.
I was back to mainland Europe after Bra&#269; as I went to Spit next. Similar to a Dubrovnik, except aimed towards a younger crowd. Split has a busy nightlife and in order to mingle with other travellers I would recommend the Tower pub crawl. For the first two hours, they use their bar specifically for people on the pub crawl before going to Splits best nightclubs.</p>

<p id="TT">Travel Tip: For transport between Croatian Islands and mainland, state-owned company Jadrolinija is best option. Occasionally tickets sell-out so purchasing one day in advance would suffice to get your desired time.</p>

<p>My next destination was a drastic environmental change. I took an 11-hour overnight train form Split to Lake Bled in Slovenia. Lake Bled what a much greener than my previous destinations. Although situated inland the huge lake and the surrounding mountains proves a surreal experience. In order to get the best view, I recommend a highly rewarding small hike up to Osojnica where you can fully take in the view.</p>

<figure><img src="images/lakebled.jpg" width=100%/><figcaption>View of The Church of Mary the Queen from Osojnica</figcaption></figure> 

<p>When in lake Bled I highly recommended a quick one hour journey to the capital of Slovenia, Ljubljana. The architecture and monuments within the capital are unique and the city carries intriguing history. Free walking tours take place here.</p>

<p id="TT">Travel Tip: before paying for a walking tour look for a free one online which allows you to tip the tour guide at the end (provides a greater motivator for the guide also).</p>

<p>My next destination was the first of the big Cities, Budapest. This city has so much to offer ranging from food, to the history, to the nightlife. Its relatively recent emergence from Communism, Budapest carries a multitude of culture as their pre-war buildings contrast the new. Once again I highly recommend the Budapest walking tour.</p>

<p id="TT">Travel Tip: when arriving in a City try do a walking tour in the first day. If the history doesn’t intrigue you at least you will become more comfortable with your surroundings.</p>

<p>Budapest is a cheap City, but you can easily pay a much higher price without your homework. Go the Jewish district to get the best value for money and avoid the tourist prices. </p>

<p>Berlin was next for me. Berlin is my favourite City for a combined number of reasons. My first is the transport system, at first may seem confusing and hectic as almost every journey requires 2 connections, but after 2 or 3 journeys when you get the hang of it, it is hard not to appreciate the German efficiency. It gives you incredibly fast access to any side of the City. </p>

<p>My second was the general environment and culture. A culture rebuilt post world war and rebuild once again post Berlin wall, the desire of expression is everywhere from the graffiti to people’s style.
My third reason, beer is cheaper than water. 
Before going to Berlin be sure to have a look online what’s going on because it is almost sure that there is some sort of an event that will suite your taste. 
Berlin is famous for its nightlife. If it is your first time and not sure where to go, make your way to Warschauer Straße, this area is full of nightclubs and your surroundings carries that Eastern Europe graffiti vibe. </p>

<p>My last stop was Amsterdam and what a great way to end my holiday. There’s no way to describe Amsterdam in a few sentences it’s just a place that must be experienced.
Stemming from the unique personalities that once resided here such as Vincent van Gough to Ann Frank it provides numerous historical attractions. Even a simple stroll throughout the streets you can see where VVG got his motivation from.
</p>

<p>The numerous interlocking river canals provide a release from the hustle and bustle by complementing the contrasting chill atmosphere. Taking one of the canal tours is worth doing. Sitting in a boat and bringing the scenery to the viewer is a much more <s>lazy</s> relaxing form of sightseeing.
 Geographically one of the smallest capitals in Europe but the narrow streets and alleyways make it potentially one of the easiest to get lost in. 
It’s increasing popularity has made it a very cheap destination to fly to. </p>

<p>After spending three weeks traveling around Europe I think it’s the cheapest way to experience a multitude of cultures and destinations in the one trip. It provides so much to offer. I recommend your own research on which destinations appeal to you and try work your journey around your own personal preferences. </p>
