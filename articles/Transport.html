	<h3>Transport Advice</h3>
	<h4>By Dáithí O'Connell</h4>
	
	<h8 id="flights">Flights</h8>
	
	<p> Flights are obviously my priority form of transport, fastest and coming from the isolated nation of Ireland it is often my only option for travelling internationally. Thanks to Ryanair’s pricing, the air transport industry has become a more affordable substitute to water, rail or bus. Air also saves a lot of time in comparison to rail or bus which can be used for tourist activities to get the most out of your holiday. So, a quick search on Skyscanner is always worth a shot. Due to high difference in costs between airports and the increase in amounts of airports Kiwi.com is another app/website well worth checking out. Rather than just entering your departure and destination the app allows for you to enter a radius circle on the map of the world so you can see all the options for where your willing to travel from to the area where your willing to travel to.</p>
		
	<p id="TT">Travel Tip: Not all apps show every indirect flight. Try connecting your flights manually by flying to a main airport such as Heathrow or Berlin Tegel Airport<p>
		
	<h8 id="Rail">Rail</h8>
	
	<p>Rail can be a comfortable and highly accessible form of transport but this depends highly on what part of the planet you are on. Thanks to the interrail tickets, trains are the cheapest and most frequent form of transport around Europe (provided you have 5 or more trips). However, when you reach certain parts such as Croatia, Serbia, Romania and other beautiful countries in Eastern Europe train stations and timetables can become more and more scarce to come by. 
Interrail passes can be bought from €170 which will allow you to travel within 30 countries. Please <a href="http://www.interrail.eu/interrail-passes/global-pass" target="_blank">click here</a> for all prices.</p>

<p><a href="http://interrailplanner.com" target="_blank">www.interrailplanner.com</a>is a great site to ensure your routes are in working order before your trip. It allows you to save multiple potential routes before your travels. After your departure and destination is entered, click ‘view travel options’ which will provide you with a link to <a href="http://www.rome2rio.com" target="_blank">www.rome2rio.com</a> with all potential transport options between the 2 locations.</p>

<h8 id="Road">Road</h8>

<p>Buses and shared taxis are often the best form of transport. Remember to ask at reception in your Hostel as they can often organise a taxi and perhaps find other travellers in the hostel to split that fare.</p>

<p>If the interrail pass doesn’t satisfy your journey entirely, buses can be your best option. In fact, if you are buying transport tickets per trip buses are cheaper due to more competition. As previously mentioned <a href="http://www.rome2rio.com" target="_blank">www.rome2rio.com</a> is a site I highly recommend when comparing all you bus options. This even works for short range distances if you want to be organised for airport to town journeys for example.</p>
		
<p id="TT">Travel Tip: If booking per journey buses are often cheaper.</p>
