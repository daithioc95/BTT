	<h3>Chicago: the number 1 for a J1</h3>
	<h4>by Adrian Quinn</h4>
	
	<p>Having spent the 3 best of months of my life in Chicago during the summer of 2016, there is not a place in America I could recommend more for someone to do a J1 there than Chicago. In truth no matter where you go on your j1 you will have an amazing time, but if you my follow my tip, you will thank me forever, I promise!</p>

	<p>The two biggest fears of a student planning a J1 is will I get a job and am I going to be homeless (trust me I know), but going to a city like Chicago erases that fear. Finding a place in Chicago was easy, after 1 day me and my 3 friends had found an apartment in downtown Chicago (although at a high cost). But I wouldn’t worry too much about being as close to downtown as possible, the CTA transport system in Chicago is one of the best I’ve seen. If you get an opportunity to live close to Wrigleyville – grab it with both hands! Wrigley field is where the Chicago cubs, and after recently winning the MLB world series for the first time in 108 years you can guarantee there’s going to be a yearlong party in Wrigleyville.  Also just around the corner is Clarke street, which is a street packed with bars and cool places to eat. It’s the real American night scene which you travelled across the Atlantic for!</p>

	<p>With regards to finding a job, being in a city the size of Chicago makes it so much easier then job hunting in somewhere like Myrtle Beach (not dissing Myrtle Beach – just trying to prove a point). I sent emails to numerous bars and restaurants with my cv and had landed an interview before I had even got on the plane. Once in Chicago I printed off 50 Cvs and went around handing them out. I ended up landing a job in ice cream parlour called Jenis Splendid ice cream in Damen, it’s the nicest ice cream you will ever taste – I’ve been craving their salted caramel ever since I got home. If you can try get a job in a service role such as a bartender or waitress as Americans are obliged to tip and after tip quite generously so it’s the best way to earn money.</p>

	<p>There wasn’t one day in Chicago were I found myself with nothing to do. It’s an amazing city with so much to do! Lake Michigan is only a 15-minute walk from the city and its where I spent some of the best days of my summer messing on the beaches. There aren’t many cities in the world that can offer you beach vibes and city vibes at the same time. If beaches aren’t your thing don’t worry Chicago has to offer, then just beaches. Head down to Millennium Park to see the bean or wander through Lincoln park which is completely fee. If you’re a big fan of seeing things, I would recommend buying the city pass. It might some expensive at the time but for $100 it gives you the access to the best things to do such as the Sky deck in Willis tower. Chicago is also home to two of the best festivals I have been too. ‘Mamby on the beach’ is a two-day festival which takes part at the end of June and had acts such as Milky Chance and Djs like Hannah wants performing – want more could you want then Techno on a beach? Lollapalooza is a 4-day festival which attracts the best acts in world and takes place dead centre in the city of Chicago and causes the whole of downtown Chicago to go on shut down. With acts such as The Chilli Peppers headlining, it is a festival you will remember for the rest of your life.</p>

	<p>Chicago is also home to some of the greatest sports teams in America. I would recommend you get to as many different sports games as possible, whether your into sports or not! Also, you have to go to the 6 flags theme park! It might seem like a like a trek to get up there as it is around two hours out of the city, but it really is worth it! Make sure you get there early and leave late though, and I would recommend going on a weekend as ques can take over an hour which isn’t really enjoyable.</p>

	<p>Also Chicago is pretty central, so when it comes to traveling it means you will have the best of both worlds as the likes of Las Vegas on the West Coast and New York on the East Coast are only a cheap flight away.</p>
	
	<p id="lastp">You will end up getting loads of recommendations to spend your j1 in places like San Fran, New York, California etc. and they will all sound amazing. But my experience in the ‘Windy City’ was to good not to encourage people to go there.</p>
