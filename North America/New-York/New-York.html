	<h3>J1: New York City</h3>
	<h4>by John McAuliffe</h4>
	
	<p>New York City. The city that never sleeps. It is an amazing place to be in, but also hard to live in for a student, even if it is just for a summer. One thing you need to be before you go is organised, which is one piece of advice that I should have adhered to in hindsight. However, a j1 can still be an amazing experience.</p>
	
	<p>New York is notoriously one of the most expensive places to live in the world. According to Business insider, it is number 11 on the most expensive cities to live in. It is the only US city in the top 20 which is an indication as to how much money you need to be able to live there for a summer or even go there for a few weeks for a holiday. Manhattan obviously is the most expensive place to live, followed by Brooklyn. With many Students who go over to the U.S, there is always an issue of overcrowding in accommodations. To be honest, unless you find a very cheap place, students will have to overcrowd to bring the rent down. It’s a reality for j1 students and unless you have a lot of money to go over with, it’s the only option.</p>
	
	<p>There is so much to see in New York. Manhattan has many tourist attractions including the statue of liberty, the one world trade centre, the Rockefeller centre and the empire state building. There is options to pay online for tickets to all these attractions, which are cheaper than paying full price and lining up for a long time. Some options include perks like skipping the line. I would recommend this because you get more time see the attraction and are also saving money by doing so. A lot of the attractions cost around $30-$35 online.</p>
	
	<p>A tip when visiting attractions would be to not bother buying tickets to the Statue of Liberty Island and instead take the Staten Island ferry. This is a free service which accommodates commuters from Staten Island to Manhattan. It passes the Statue of Liberty so you can see it and get pictures from a distance. Another tip would be to go to the Rockefeller centre instead of the Empire state building. The only real reason why you would go to the empire state would be just to say you were on it. The Rockefeller centre is cheaper and basically has the same view. It also has an open roof which you can stand on top of and have a better view of the city and the surrounding boroughs.</p>

	<p>There are also many free things to see in the city. The high line is an old above ground subway line that was turned into a garden. It’s a very impressive area and is a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the city streets. You can also see the whole way down the length of 11th avenue from one viewpoint as well as seeing Jersey City from across the Hudson River. Central Park is also a major attraction to the city. Reaching from 58th street all the way up to 110th street, it is the largest city park in the world and completely free to enter.</p>
	
	<p>The fastest way of getting around New York is the Subway. Similar to the leap card here, you can get a 7 day unlimited pass. It is a big money saver. There is also a 30 day option too but I would recommend the 7 day pass because if you lose the 30 day one, it’s around $90 dollars down the drain.</p>
	
	<p id="lastp">New York is an amazing city with lots to see, but it is expensive. You should always keep track of your money because you could spend it so easily over there. I spent $500 one week and had nothing really significant to show for it. Like anywhere you just have to be careful with your money and New York City is no different.</p>
