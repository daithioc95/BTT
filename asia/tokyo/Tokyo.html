	<h3>Tokyo</h3>
	<h4>By Liam O'Connell</h4>

<p>Japan is a country that offers fantastic opportunities to explore fantastic food, experience a new culture and meet some very friendly, beer loving people. </p>

<p>The country’s bespoke and infamous transport system, known as the Shinkansen opens up a world of opportunity to avid backpackers, offering the fastest transport in the world. This incredibly efficient service does, however, come at a price, with Japanese transport being thought to be amongst the most expensive in the world, but can you blame them? </p>

<p>While returning from a holiday in Australia, I decided to schedule a 5-day stopover in Tokyo to see what all the hype was about and I was not disappointed. My first advice to any backpacker is to purchase a Japanese rail card, these are the best kept secret. You can purchase them for any length of time and you can be guaranteed that you will receive it in Japanese efficiency. The cost of the Japanese rail card can vary depending on the length of time you wish to travel, however, you are guaranteed to make your money back within days of arriving in the country. With this Rail Pass you are entitled to travel on any Japanese Rail service throughout the country and you will also be able to use it in on the JR subway in Tokyo. As I was somewhat tight on time, I spent most of my time in Japan exploring Tokyo, while it is a phenominal city, my advice is to dedicate 4/5 days to Tokyo which will allow you to explore each of the main districts, Shinjuku – The ‘Cool’ Side, Roppongi - the nightlife area and Akihabara for the gaming world.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for Sushi, your best bet of finding it is at the fish market in tsukiji, however, the quest for each of the stalls can be a bit unnerving. In my opionion, the best attractions I found were free, you can go to the top of the Tokyo Government Buildings absolutely free and they will give you a free tour and your will get a birds-eye view of the city, and Mt. Fuji, I recommend doing this early as you can get advice from the tour guides on where to explore.</p>

<p id="lastp"> I also recommend dedicating one of your days in Tokyo to getting a train to a lovely traditional town called Nikko, 1 hour 45 mins outside Tokyo where you will have an opportunity to experience what Japan is all about. I highly recommended recooperating in Hakone for a day or two, this area is known for its natural spas and also has some fantastic surroundings, I have been told to try go on a day where it is not raining!. If you’re an adventurer, it would definitely be worth your while exploring Mt. Fuji and you could probably allocate two-days to this visit. Next, I would recommend spending a few days in Kyoto, this was once the capital of Japan and it has retained all the traditional Japanese features, the best way to explore this city is on a bike.</p>
