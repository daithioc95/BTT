	<h3>Routes of South-East Asia</h3>
	<h4>By Róisín O'Connell</h4>
	
	<p>South East Asia is the perfect spot to travel to if you’re looking to get more bang for your buck! Although the expense of traveling over there will prove to be the most expensive part by a long shot, Emirates Airline does offer fantastic deals to travellers who book early enough in advance. Bangkok airport is one of the cheapest destinations to travel to and Skyscanner also offer an option to book a multi-trip (with different arrival and departure airports). Although this initially appears to be more expensive, it in fact works out cheaper in the long run by time extra flights and accommodation required for you to go back to your original airport are added to the mix.</p>
	
	<p>On arrival to Asia be warned that taxi services can spot foreigners a mile off and will try to charge you extortionate rates to get from A to B. This point should start the beginning of a beautiful and budding relationship between you and travelfish.org. This website provides you with first-hand knowledge of the cheapest and safest modes of transport to and from specific areas and even the respectable amount to be charged to certain routes. Travelfish also provide advice on accommodation, places and eat and much, much more.</p>
	
	<p>While Hostelworld and Agoda are great for checking out available accommodation and more importantly their standards, it actually works out cheaper to book your accommodation directly, as these middle men add a service charge.</p>
	
	<p>South-East Asia has such beautiful treasures to experience. While the hustle and bustle of Bangkok city is not to be missed, make sure to put some time aside to visit Thailand’s glorious islands. Koh Phangan’s full moon party is a must, so try and make sure to arrange your dates around it! Don’t forget, however, to book accommodation well in advance as it books up very quickly. Also, make sure that its right beside the beach itself, as some places advertise that they are close but they can be over an hour away. Ko Tao is another must see Thai island and is famous for its Scuba Diving courses, as they are one of the cheapest in the world!</p>
	
	<p>Vietnam is another country to check off that bucket list. Sapa caters for those interested in trekking and out of this world views, Halong Bay is an unbelievable, peaceful bit of heaven, while Ho Chi Minh City provides a fantastic indept into the brutality of the Vietnamese War with its tour of the Cu Chi Tunnels and the War Remnants Museum.</p>
	
	<p>George Town (also known as Penang) in Malaysia is a loveable city to walk around and experience. It has world famous 3D street art which is a must see for art lovers. Love lane is a popular destination for backpackers as this is where the cheapest accommodation can be found. Drink prices can be expensive in Malaysia, however, George Town’s Tipsy Tiger Hostel offers beds at great rates and all you can drink at their bar for the equivalent of around €7. Sleeper buses are the most economical for the backpacker around these areas. Not only are they the cheapest mode of transport, they also save you a night’s accommodation cost. Cheap sleeper buses can be arranged from Penang to the Perhentian Islands. Here diving lovers have another opportunity to either get their Padi licence or partake in cheap fun dives.  Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpar cannot be missed. Very similar to big Western cities, K.L. consists of massive skyscrapers along with the architectural beauty of the Petronas Towers. The KL Tower provides tourists with a 360° view of the entire city.</p>
	
	<p id="lastp">As you can see, traveling around South Eastern Asia offers a huge variety of experiences. From big cities, to quiet, calm and unspoilt beaches, there’s somewhere to suit everyone! Money can also go a long way in this part of the world, with meals in some places costing under €2 and an average night’s stay in a hostel around €5! Another tip for keeping you in the green for longer is to look for hostels that provide free accommodation and food in exchange for work!</p>
